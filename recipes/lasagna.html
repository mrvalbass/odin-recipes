    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions.</p>
    <p>There is a fresh version of lasagna that requires pre-boiling the pasta before filling it or adding sauce and then baking. There are also commercial versions, however, that allow for spreading the pasta in a baking pan and filling it or adding more liquid sauces so that the pasta softens during cooking. The sauces may be based on tomatoes and meat, cheese, pesto or even vegetables and béchamel. On top of it all, there is a layer of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, and it is baked for a length of time that depends on the type of lasagna noodles used.</p>

        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir ground beef, onion, and garlic in a large skillet over medium heat for 5 minutes; drain fat.</li>
        <li>Mix in diced tomatoes, tomato paste, brown sugar, basil, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and oregano. Simmer meat sauce, stirring occasionally, for 30 to 45 minutes.</li>

        <li>Layer 1/3 of the noodles in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 1/2 of the ricotta mixture.</li>
        <li>Cover the ricotta mixture with 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, and 1/3 of the meat sauce.</li>
        <li>Repeat. Top with remaining noodles and meat sauce. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese over the top.</li>
